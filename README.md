White box testing is a form of application testing that provides the tester with complete knowledge of the application being tested, including access to source code and design documents. This in-depth visibility makes it possible for white box testing to identify issues that are invisible to gray and black box testing.

Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) languages. It is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.
You can use it to declare different kinds of exceptions, add custom logic to existing frameworks, and even map your domain model to a database.
This is something you can use to build rpg classes and subclasses, the main class is the parent class. The subclass would inherit the information from the parent class using that as a base while adding on it’s ownconcepts.

3 levels of scope 
class
Method 
and 
block


Class scope: is the fields when it is declared outside of a mehtod



Method scope: when a  variable is defined in a method



Block scope:for you if’s or your for loops

Everything inside of c# is an object

What deis everything inherit from an object oriented language?

Everything inherits from objects

When your first getting started,grid will resize sometimes when you dropp things in

Canvas:don’t use it for deployed apps because the dimensions remain static

When you declare a new instance like this it will assign the last index to this address

If it is an array behind the scenes
